# Vanitati

Letter Grade: H (Honors)

The goal of this project was to create a networked multiplayer turn-based strategy game with a focus on long-term planning over reactionary game play.

The technical aspects of the submitted project were sound, though the game itself requires further work to create a fun experience.
